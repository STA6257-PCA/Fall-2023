# Summary

In recent times, the utilization of large datasets has become widespread across numerous fields. To confront the challenges posed by these complex datasets with multiple variables, unsupervised learning algorithms, particularly Principal Component Analysis (PCA), assume a crucial role in various tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization. The roots of PCA can be traced back to Karl Pearson's conceptualization in 1901, with subsequent formalization by Harold Hotelling in 1933. PCA's primary objective is to reduce data dimensionality while preserving its inherent variability. It achieves this by generating principal components, which serve as representatives for variables, thereby simplifying data representation and enhancing exploratory data analysis. The underlying mathematical framework of PCA revolves around identifying eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. With the development of software packages, PCA has become easily accessible for data analysis. However, PCA is most effective when data patterns result in statistical variance that can be captured by the principal components, making it a potent tool for data exploration but less suitable for non-linear or non-orthogonal data. Careful consideration must be given to proper data scaling. PCA finds application in diverse fields such as archaeology, neuroscience, and the arts, enabling practitioners to explore datasets, preprocess data, and streamline analysis. Moreover, it has found utility in computer vision for tasks like facial recognition, showcasing its prowess in reducing dimensionality while preserving crucial information. Overall, PCA is a versatile and widely used technique in statistics and data analysis, providing a valuable means to extract insights from complex datasets and simplify decision-making processes across diverse domains.
