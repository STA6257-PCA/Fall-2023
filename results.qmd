# Results and Conclusion

The Dialysis dataset consists of 55 observations of 39 variables with 1 discrete variable (States/Territories) and 38 continuous variables. Principal component analysis was performed using a singular value decomposition approach to calculate the principal components of the 38 continuous variables. Of the resulting principal components, the first PC captures 40.80% of the variance in the data, and the first two principal components capture 50.27% of the variance. The first four PCs capture 67.66% of the variance, or just over two-thirds; after the fourth PC, the variance captured by each successive PC begins to diminish relative to PCs one through four. The first ten PCs capture 88.67% of the variance, and in terms of dimensionality reduction over 90% of the information in the dataset can be explained by only 11 PCs when compared to the original 38 continuous variables.

The variables which contribute the most to PC1 are expected_hospital_readmission, expected_transfusion, and expected_hospitalization, although the percent of total contribution to PC1 by any one variable is not outsized relative to the remaining variables. PC2, which is orthogonal to PC1, has relatively large contributions from the five variables measuring levels of phosphorus; patterns or trends in the data such as these can be further explored using other methodologies after being highlighted in PCA.

From here, the analysis extends PCA via model building using linear regression, a technique known as principal component regression, with expected_survival used as the response variable. The first 8 principle components accounting for 84.03% of the variance are used.
