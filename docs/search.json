To confront the challenges posed by these complex datasets with multiple variables, unsupervised learning algorithms, particularly Principal Component Analysis (PCA), assume a crucial role in various tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and data visualization. The roots of PCA can be traced back to Karl Pearson’s conceptualization in 1901, with subsequent formalization by Harold Hotelling in 1933. PCA’s primary objective is to reduce data dimensionality while preserving its inherent variability. It achieves this by generating principal components, which serve as representatives for variables, thereby simplifying data representation and enhancing exploratory data analysis. The underlying mathematical framework of PCA revolves around identifying eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. With the development of software packages, PCA has become easily accessible for data analysis. However, PCA is most effective when data patterns result in statistical variance that can be captured by the principal components, making it a potent tool for data exploration but less suitable for non-linear or non-orthogonal data. Careful consideration must be given to proper data scaling. PCA finds application in diverse fields such as archaeology, neuroscience, and the arts, enabling practitioners to explore datasets, preprocess data, and streamline analysis. Moreover, it has found utility in computer vision for tasks like facial recognition, showcasing its prowess in reducing dimensionality while preserving crucial information. Overall, PCA is a versatile and widely used technique in statistics and data analysis, providing a valuable means to extract insights from complex datasets and simplify decision-making processes across diverse domains."

    "section": "1.1 Theoretical and mathematical foundations",
    "text": "1.1 Theoretical and mathematical foundations\nThe fundamental concept behind PCA is to explain the variability in a set of correlated variables with a smaller set of uncorrelated variables, thus mitigating issues such as multicollinearity. The geometric properties of PCs facilitate an intuitive interpretation of key features within complex multivariate datasets [8]; the first principal component represents the direction with the greatest variation in the original data, while subsequent components are uncorrelated with the previous ones. Each component can be interpreted as the direction that maximizes the variance of the original data when projecting new observations onto the components [1]. PCA aims to capture a significant proportion of the original variables’ variation in the first few components, offering a practical lower-dimensional summary. While other methods may involve weighted averages across related variables to reduce dimensions, PCA often achieves similar results with minimal loss of variance information [9]. The mathematical foundations of PCA center around data of p variables in n observations, represented by an n x p matrix X with the goal of finding a linear combination of the columns of X which maximize variance. By maximizing the variance in these linear combinations, we can capture the largest amount of statistical information possible among the dimensions of the dataset. As described by Jolliffe and Cadima [2], this boils down to finding the eigenvectors (a) and the largest eigenvalues () of the covariance matrix S, where Xak are the linear combinations called the principal components. \nWith the development of software packages in computer languages such as R and Python, the computational burden of PCA for large datasets can be easily handled by software; PCA has become easy to use as part of any data processing pipeline. Abdi and Williams describe PCA as “probably the most popular multivariate statistical technique … used by almost all scientific disciplines.” [10] Abdi and Williams also emphasize that the goals of PCA should be extracting only the most important information from a dataset to both compress and simplify the dataset and provide a way to analyze the structure of the observations and variables more easily. Importantly, the authors also offer a geometric description of the principal components as orthogonal factors to the original axis of the dataset; another strength of PCA is the fact that the technique can be explained and expressed through several mathematical avenues. Finally, Abdi and Williams offer methods to evaluate the quality of the “PCA model” in reconstructing the original data matrix using the derived principal components. For example, calculating the residual sum of squares, or RESS, after rebuilding X provides a way to identify model accuracy by seeking a minimal RESS value from X and X. \nLever and Altman [11] offer similar praises of PCA while echoing the cautions of prior authors as a powerful data exploration tool with clear limitations. PCA is best when interesting patterns in data produce statistical variance which can be capture by the principal components, but the technique is far less effective when patterns in data are non-linear or non-orthogonal or when the maximization of variance fails to produce interesting clusters in the principal component space. Scaling is often necessary for PCA to ensure compatibility across variables with different scales and ranges. The original data is typically standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1 [8]. PCA can be used improperly to produce results that obfuscate the actual statistical content of the dataset; scaling may influence the analysis with prior knowledge of the data, so the decision to scale the data and the scaling methodology should be considered carefully."

    "section": "1.2 Applications and extensions",
    "text": "1.2 Applications and extensions\n\n1.2.1 In Archeology, Neuroscience, and the Arts \nPCA has been utilized by many authors across numerous fields as an essential part of a data analysis pipeline. As an example of the application of PCA, Jolliffe and Cadima [2] present a dataset of 88 observations with 9 variables of measurement for fossilized mammal teeth including length in two dimensions, width in two dimensions, and more. With the R statistical language, finding and displaying the principal components of the dataset becomes trivial work where patterns can be identified graphically in a two-dimensional (PC1 x PC2) plot, versus the original scatterplot which would be displayed in nine-dimensional space. The development of statistical software has made it straightforward for practitioners to use PCA for data exploration and dimensionality reduction. Authors such as Maindonald and Braun [12] have produced publications which present techniques and step-by-step methodologies of using R to calculate principal components and graphically display the results. Their presentation includes code snippets which can be run in R software environments along with worked examples and a discussion of results, facilitating the use of the technique for practitioners of all experience levels.\nFelipe Gewers and their research team directly expound on Abdi and Williams’ description of PCA as “the most popular multivariate statistical technique [...]” in an analysis of publications which use PCA: Across twenty-three disciplines ranging from Neuroscience to the Arts, PCA is used to explore a dataset before analysis, used as part of a spectrum of statistical analysis tools prior to modeling and analysis, or used to preprocess and simplify data for direct analysis and modeling [13]. The authors also discuss the broad effectiveness of PCA in representing more than 50% of the variance in most datasets using only the first three principal components. They also highlight how differences in captured variance appear between standardization and non-standardization, and in different fields of study; PCA can be effective in an incredibly diverse array of data when applied appropriately. As an exploratory technique with a long tenure in the field of statistics and data analysis, PCA is tried and true in simplifying datasets and allowing practitioners to identify and explore the largest sources of statistical information present in their data.\nPrincipal Component Analysis is also implemented in Scikit Learn with randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction in data analysis, particularly for face recognition and similar high-dimensional data applications. For instance, with an image of 4096 dimensions (64x64 pixel gray scale images) PCA can transform the data into a lower 200 dimension format that still captures the essential information [14]. With randomized SVD it becomes computationally more efficient to approximate the singular vectors, which are then used to perform the transformation. This approach significantly reduces computation time and memory usage. Additionally, PCA decomposes a multivariate dataset into orthogonal components that explain the maximum amount of variance. It can center and optionally scale the input data before applying SVD. Scaling can be useful for downstream models, such as Support Vector Machines with the RBF kernel and K-Means clustering, which assume certain properties of the data distribution.\n\n\n1.2.2 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\nThe Eigenfaces concept has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to facial detection and recognition. The Eigenfaces algorithm employs PCA to extract essential facial features, reducing the dimensionality of face images while retaining crucial information. The Eigenfaces technique represents facial images in high-dimensional space while projecting the images onto a lower-dimensional space. Turk and Pentland demonstrated the effectiveness of Eigenfaces in recognizing faces under various conditions, including variations in lighting, facial expressions, and pose [15]. The potential implications of this research extend beyond face recognition, and have broader implications for image analysis, computer vision, and biometric systems. The paper Eigenfaces by Zhang and Turk provided an insightful exploration of the Eigenfaces method [16], considered as the first working technique in facial recognition. Eigenfaces leverage the power of PCA to represent facial images compactly and efficiently, making it possible to recognize faces in various contexts.\nThe idea of principal components to represent human faces was developed by Sirovich and Kirby in 1987 and used by Turk and Pentland in 1991 [15] for face detection and recognition. The authors describe the mathematical principles behind PCA, and its adaptation for facial recognition, capturing the most prominent facial features while reducing the dimensionality of the data. Specifically, the eigenfaces are the principal components of a distribution of faces, or the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the set of face images, where an image with N pixels is considered a point (or vector) in N-dimensional space. Emphasis is placed on the versatility of Eigenfaces in handling variations in lighting, pose, and facial expressions, making it a robust tool for real-world applications.\nThis application of PCA represents one of many for a longstanding technique in the rapidly growing field of statistics and data analysis. The unsupervised learning algorithm plays a vital role in dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and visualization of complex data sets. Understanding PCA is crucial for researchers, and students seeking to extract meaningful insights and patterns from high-dimensional data to simplify the decision-making process.\n\n\n\n\n[1] M.

    "text": "2.3 Eigenvectors\nPCA uses eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues to calculate the principal components; a brief overview is given here. Eigen is a German word meaning inherent or characteristic, and an eigenvector can be described geometrically as a nonzero vector \\(a\\) of a linear transformation matrix \\(M\\) which does not change direction when the transformation is applied; the only change that occurs is a scaling by factor \\(\\lambda\\), the eigenvalue of the eigenvector \\(a\\). Such a characteristic vector is useful in PCA, where the goal is to maximize variance while reducing dimensionality, and in this context the eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be thought of as the inherent components of the dataset which contain the most important information. Eigenvalues can be calculated from the characteristic polynomial of the matrix, by taking the determinant of \\(M - \\lambda I\\), where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix. Setting this expression equal to zero allows the calculation of the eigenvalues as the roots of the characteristic polynomial; the resulting equation is called the characteristic equation:\n\\[\ndet(M - \\lambda I) = 0\n\\tag{2.1}\\]\nAn eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_k\\) can be used to solve for some eigenvector \\(a_k\\) with the equation \\((M - \\lambda I)a = 0\\). With PCA, we can use the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to compute the PCs. [3]"

    "section": "2.4 Principal Component Analysis",
    "text": "2.4 Principal Component Analysis\nIn this approach to PCA, SVD is used to extract the most information (variance) from the data matrix while reducing the dimensionality of the data. The first principal component will have the largest possible variance (also called inertia), whose value is defined as a factor score. Factor scores represent a geometric projection of the observations onto the PCs. The second PC, orthogonal to the first, has the second largest variance, and the third PC would continue this pattern. The calculation of PCs via SVD can be understood with the use of matrix operations on a dataset. [4]\n\n2.4.1 Centering and Scaling\nLet our dataset be represented by the \\(N \\times P\\) matrix \\(X\\) comprised of \\(N\\) observations of \\(P\\) variables in the data set, where any element \\(x_{np}\\) represents the \\(n\\)th observation of variable \\(p\\) in the dataset. The matrix \\(X\\) has rank \\(A\\) where \\(A \\leq min\\{N, P\\}\\). The data in \\(X\\) is centered and scaled, such that the mean of each column \\(X_p\\) is 0 and every \\(x_{np}\\) has been standardized with unit variance. We can represent this with the formula:\n\\[\nz_{np} = \\frac{x_{np} - \\bar{x}_{p}}{{\\sigma_{p}}}\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\n\n\n2.4.2 Eigendecomposition of the Covariance Matrix\nThe aim of PCA is to find some linear combination of the columns of \\(X\\) which maximizes the variance. If we define \\(a\\) as a vector of constants \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_p\\), then \\(Xa\\) represents the linear combination of interest. The variance of \\(Xa\\) is represented by \\(var(Xa) = a^TSa\\), with the covariance matrix \\(S\\), and \\(T\\) representing the transpose operator. Finding the \\(Xa\\) with maximum variance equates to finding the vector \\(a\\) which maximizes the quadratic \\(a^TSa\\), where \\(a^Ta = 1\\). We can write this as \\(a^TSa - \\lambda(a^Ta-1)\\), with the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\). [5] Equating this expression to the null vector \\(0\\) allows us to differentiate with respect to \\(a\\):\n\\[\nSa - \\lambda a = 0 \\Rightarrow Sa = \\lambda a\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nTherefore, \\(a\\) is a unit-norm eigenvector with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) of the covariance matrix \\(S\\). The largest eigenvalue of \\(S\\) is \\(\\lambda_1\\) with the eigenvector \\(a_1\\), which we can define for any eigenvector \\(a\\):\n\\[\nvar(Xa) = a^TSa = \\lambda a^Ta = \\lambda\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nAny \\(p \\times p\\) real symmetric matrix has exactly \\(p\\) real eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_k\\) for \\(k = 1,...,p\\). The corresponding eigenvectors of these eigenvalues can be defined to form an orthonormal set of vectors such that \\(a_k^Ta_{k^T} = 1\\) if \\(k = k^T\\) and zero otherwise. If we consider that \\(S\\) is such a matrix and impose the restriction of orthogonality to the different coefficient vectors of \\(S\\), the full set of eigenvectors of \\(S\\) represent the solutions to finding linear combinations \\(Xa_k\\) which maximize variance while minimizing correlation with prior linear combinations. \\(Xa_k\\) then represent the linear combinations which are the principal components of the dataset with eigenvectors \\(a_k\\) and eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_k\\). The elements of \\(Xa_k\\) are the factor scores of the PCs, while the elements of the eigenvectors \\(a_k\\) represent the loadings of the PCs. [1]\n\n\n2.4.3 Singular Value Decomposition\nNext we define the singular value decomposition of \\(X\\). Let \\(L\\) be the \\(N \\times A\\) matrix of left singular vectors of the matrix; that is, the columns of \\(L\\) are made up of the eigenvectors of \\(XX^T\\). Let \\(R\\) be the \\(P \\times A\\) matrix of right singular vectors; the columns of \\(R\\) are made up of the eigenvectors of \\(X^TX\\). Finally, let \\(D\\) be the diagonal matrix of singular values, meaning the singular values in \\(D\\) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \\(XX^T\\) and \\(X^TX\\), and \\(D^2\\) is defined as the diagonal matrix of the non-zero eigenvalues. We can define the singular value decomposition of matrix \\(X\\) as:\n\\[\nX = LD{R}^T\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nIn this context, the eigenvalues represent the variances of the principal components and summarily contain the important information for the dataset, and we can obtain the PCs of \\(X\\) from the SVD. [6] With the identity matrix \\(I\\), the \\(I \\times R\\) matrix of factor scores can be expressed as:\n\\[\nF = LD\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nThese factor scores are calculated from the coefficients of the linear combinations in matrix \\(R\\), which can be defined as a projection matrix of the original observations onto the PCs, i.e. the product of \\(X\\) and \\(R\\):\n\\[\nF = LD = LDR^TR = XR\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nThe matrix \\(R\\) is also referred to as a loading matrix, and \\(X\\) is often described as the product of the factor score matrix and the loading matrix:\n\\[\nX = FR^T\n\\tag{2.8}\\]\nwith the decomposition of \\(F^TF = D^2\\) and \\(R^TR = I\\).\nThe loadings represent the weights of the original variables in the computation of the PCs; in other words, the correlation from -1 to 1 of each variable with the factor score.\nIn a geometric interpretation of PCA, the factor scores measure length on the Cartesian plane. This length represents the projection of the original observations onto the PCs from the origin at \\((0, 0)\\). This is especially useful as a visualization of higher dimension data in two dimensions by utilizing the first two PCs which capture the most variance in the original data. [7]"

    "text": "2.5 Interpretation of the Principal Components\nThere are several ways to interpret the PCs derived from the analysis. Since the eigenvalues represent the variance of the PCs, the proportion of the eigenvalues explain the proportion of variation in the dataset. Using a scree plot, these eigenvalues are plotted to show how much variation each PC explains. Another commonly used tool is a biplot, a combination of the plots of the factor scores (points) and the loadings (vectors) for two PCs (typically PC1 and PC2). The biplot is meant to visually capture the relationship between the original variables and the principal components. Clusters of points represent highly correlated variables, and vector lengths represent the variability captured in that direction on the principal component axis.

    "text": "3.2 PCA on a large dataset using R\nFor this application of PCA, the Abalone dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is used [2]. This dataset contain 4177 observations of 9 variables which record characteristics of each abalone including sex, length, diameter, height, weights, and the number of rings. The variables, apart from sex, are continuous and correlated making the dataset an ideal candidate for demonstrating dimensionality reduction via PCA.\n\n3.2.1 Libraries\nFirst, the appropriate and necessary libraries are loaded in R. These provide the functions which serve as the backbone of the analysis, handling the computational aspects of PCA as well as visualizing the results.\n\n\nCode\n# Load necessary libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)  # for handling missing values\nlibrary(corrplot) # for plotting the correlation matrix\nlibrary(factoextra) # PCA plots\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Data Preparation\n\n\nCode\n# clear environment\nrm(list = ls())\n\n# Load dataset\nabalone &lt;- read.csv('./abalone/abalone.csv')\n\n# Dataset structure\nstr(abalone)\n\n\n'data.frame':   4177 obs. of  9 variables:\n $ Sex           : chr  \"M\" \"M\" \"F\" \"M\" ...\n $ Length        : num  0.455 0.35 0.53 0.44 0.33 0.425 0.53 0.545 0.475 0.55 ...\n $ Diameter      : num  0.365 0.265 0.42 0.365 0.255 0.3 0.415 0.425 0.37 0.44 ...\n $ Height        : num  0.095 0.09 0.135 0.125 0.08 0.095 0.15 0.125 0.125 0.15 ...\n $ Whole_weight  : num  0.514 0.226 0.677 0.516 0.205 ...\n $ Shucked_weight: num  0.2245 0.0995 0.2565 0.2155 0.0895 ...\n $ Viscera_weight: num  0.101 0.0485 0.1415 0.114 0.0395 ...\n $ Shell_weight  : num  0.15 0.07 0.21 0.155 0.055 0.12 0.33 0.26 0.165 0.32 ...\n $ Rings         : int  15 7 9 10 7 8 20 16 9 19 ...\n\n\nCode\n# Missing values\ncolSums(is.na(abalone))\n\n\n           Sex         Length       Diameter         Height   Whole_weight \n             0              0              0              0              0 \nShucked_weight Viscera_weight   Shell_weight          Rings \n             0              0              0              0 \n\n\nThe dataset contains 9 variables with 1 categorical variable and 8 numeric variables. The dataset contains no missing values. For this example in applying principal component analysis, we exclude the categorical variable ‘Sex’ and focus the PCA on the numerical dimensions of the Abalone. For analyses involving a mix of numeric and non-numeric variables other factor analysis techniques can be used, such as factor analysis of mixed data [3].\n\n\nCode\n# Select only the numeric variables \nabalone &lt;- abalone %&gt;% select(where(is.numeric))\n\nsummary(abalone)\n\n\n     Length         Diameter          Height        Whole_weight   \n Min.   :0.075   Min.   :0.0550   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0020  \n 1st Qu.:0.450   1st Qu.:0.3500   1st Qu.:0.1150   1st Qu.:0.4415  \n Median :0.545   Median :0.4250   Median :0.1400   Median :0.7995  \n Mean   :0.524   Mean   :0.4079   Mean   :0.1395   Mean   :0.8287  \n 3rd Qu.:0.615   3rd Qu.:0.4800   3rd Qu.:0.1650   3rd Qu.:1.1530  \n Max.   :0.815   Max.   :0.6500   Max.   :1.1300   Max.   :2.8255  \n Shucked_weight   Viscera_weight    Shell_weight        Rings       \n Min.   :0.0010   Min.   :0.0005   Min.   :0.0015   Min.   : 1.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.1860   1st Qu.:0.0935   1st Qu.:0.1300   1st Qu.: 8.000  \n Median :0.3360   Median :0.1710   Median :0.2340   Median : 9.000  \n Mean   :0.3594   Mean   :0.1806   Mean   :0.2388   Mean   : 9.934  \n 3rd Qu.:0.5020   3rd Qu.:0.2530   3rd Qu.:0.3290   3rd Qu.:11.000  \n Max.   :1.4880   Max.   :0.7600   Max.   :1.0050   Max.   :29.000  \n\n\nThe summary statistics show the differences in measurement between variables, with some variables such as diameter and viscera weight having small ranges and others, namely rings, having relatively large ranges. For this reason, scaling of the variables is a crucial step in PCA to ensure results accurately capture the variance in the data.\n\n\n3.2.3 Feature Scaling\nStandardization ensures all variables, also called features, are on the same scale, and the scale function allows us to center the data to a mean of 0 and variance of 1. This ensures no single feature has an outsized effect during the principal component analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Standardization of numerical features\nabalone_sc &lt;- scale(abalone, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)\n\nsummary(abalone_sc)\n\n\n     Length           Diameter           Height          Whole_weight     \n Min.   :-3.7387   Min.   :-3.5558   Min.   :-3.33555   Min.   :-1.68589  \n 1st Qu.:-0.6161   1st Qu.:-0.5832   1st Qu.:-0.58614   1st Qu.:-0.78966  \n Median : 0.1749   Median : 0.1725   Median : 0.01156   Median :-0.05963  \n Mean   : 0.0000   Mean   : 0.0000   Mean   : 0.00000   Mean   : 0.00000  \n 3rd Qu.: 0.7578   3rd Qu.: 0.7267   3rd Qu.: 0.60926   3rd Qu.: 0.66123  \n Max.   : 2.4232   Max.   : 2.4397   Max.   :23.68045   Max.   : 4.07178  \n Shucked_weight    Viscera_weight      Shell_weight         Rings        \n Min.   :-1.6145   Min.   :-1.64298   Min.   :-1.7049   Min.   :-2.7708  \n 1st Qu.:-0.7811   1st Qu.:-0.79455   1st Qu.:-0.7818   1st Qu.:-0.5997  \n Median :-0.1053   Median :-0.08752   Median :-0.0347   Median :-0.2896  \n Mean   : 0.0000   Mean   : 0.00000   Mean   : 0.0000   Mean   : 0.0000  \n 3rd Qu.: 0.6426   3rd Qu.: 0.66056   3rd Qu.: 0.6478   3rd Qu.: 0.3307  \n Max.   : 5.0848   Max.   : 5.28587   Max.   : 5.5040   Max.   : 5.9136  \n\n\nViewing the data after scaling and centering, values greater than 3 or less than -3 represent outliers more than 3 standard deviations from the mean. Based on the ranges of the variables, we should view a boxplot of the data to further investigate.\n\n\nCode\n# Plot a boxplot to visualize potential outliers\npar(mar=c(4, 8, 4, 4))\nboxplot(abalone_sc, col = \"steelblue\", main = \"Visualization of scaled and centered data\", horizontal = TRUE, las = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there enough outliers to be a cause for concern? We can see how many lie outside of the third standard deviation of the data for each variable.\n\n\nCode\nprint(colSums(abalone_sc &gt; 3 | abalone_sc &lt; -3))\n\n\n        Length       Diameter         Height   Whole_weight Shucked_weight \n            15             13              5             19             37 \nViscera_weight   Shell_weight          Rings \n            22             27             62 \n\n\nOf the 4177 observations, at most 62 in a single variable (rings) are outliers. The tolerance for outliers will differ depending on the investigation, but for our illustrative purposes this number is well within tolerance for principal component analysis.\nLastly, we can investigate the correlation among the variables. PCA is best used with linearly correlated data. If the data is not correlated, the results of PCA will be less meaningful.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate correlations and round to 2 digits\nabalone_corr &lt;- cor(abalone_sc)\ncorrplot(abalone_corr, method=\"number\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOur scaled and centered data has strong linear correlations and contains a relatively small number of outliers. We can now calculate the principal components of the dataset.\n\n\n3.2.4 PCA via Singular Value Decomposition\nThe prcomp() function [4] performs principal component analysis on a dataset using the singular value decomposition method, which utilizes the covariance matrix of the data.\n\n\nCode\n# Apply PCA using prcomp()\nabalone_pca &lt;- prcomp(abalone_sc)\nsummary(abalone_pca)\n\n\nImportance of components:\n                         PC1     PC2     PC3     PC4     PC5     PC6     PC7\nStandard deviation     2.591 0.83403 0.50837 0.40742 0.29146 0.25194 0.11267\nProportion of Variance 0.839 0.08695 0.03231 0.02075 0.01062 0.00793 0.00159\nCumulative Proportion  0.839 0.92601 0.95831 0.97906 0.98968 0.99761 0.99920\n                           PC8\nStandard deviation     0.07999\nProportion of Variance 0.00080\nCumulative Proportion  1.00000\n\n\n\n3.2.4.1 PCA - Cumulative Variance and Number of Principal Components\n\n\nCode\n# Principal Component scores vector\npc_scores &lt;- abalone_pca$x\n\n# Std Deviation of Components\ncomponent_sdev &lt;- abalone_pca$sdev\n\n# Eigenvector or Loadings\neigenvector &lt;- abalone_pca$rotation\n\n# Mean of variables\ncomponent_mean &lt;- abalone_pca$center \n\n# Scaling factor of Variables\ncomponent_scale &lt;- abalone_pca$scale\n\n# Proportion of variance explained by each PC\nvariance_explained &lt;- component_sdev^2 / sum(component_sdev^2)\n\n# Cumulative proportion of variance explained\ncumulative_variance_explained &lt;- cumsum(variance_explained)\n\n# Retain components that explain a percentage of the variance\nnum_components &lt;- which(cumulative_variance_explained &gt;= 0.92)[1]\n\n# Select the desired number of principal components\nselected_pcs &lt;- pc_scores[, 1:num_components]\n\n# Display cumulative variance\ncumulative_variance_explained\n\n\n[1] 0.8390549 0.9260065 0.9583119 0.9790606 0.9896793 0.9976134 0.9992002\n[8] 1.0000000\n\n\nThe first 2 principal components alone explain 92% of the variance in the data.\n\n\n3.2.4.2 Loading of First Two Components\nThe loading are the weights assigned to each variable for that particular principal component.\n\n\nCode\n# Access the loadings for the first two principal components\nloadings_first_two_components &lt;- eigenvector[, 1:2]\n\n# Print the loadings for the first two principal components\nprint(\"Loadings for the first two principal components:\")\n\n\n[1] \"Loadings for the first two principal components:\"\n\n\nCode\nprint(loadings_first_two_components)\n\n\n                     PC1         PC2\nLength         0.3721385  0.06828270\nDiameter       0.3730941  0.04004804\nHeight         0.3400268 -0.07046315\nWhole_weight   0.3783075  0.13734619\nShucked_weight 0.3624545  0.29883992\nViscera_weight 0.3685578  0.17297852\nShell_weight   0.3707578 -0.04540040\nRings          0.2427128 -0.92120385\n\n\n\n\n3.2.4.3 PCA - Elements\nThe values in abalone_pca$x are the coordinates of each observation in the new principal component space.

PC1 explains 83.9% of the variance, and PC2 explains 8.7% variance.\n\n\n3.2.5.2 Biplot\nThe correlation between a variable and a principal component is used as the coordinates of the variable on the PC, shown as dimensions on the biplot. Dim1 corresponds to PC1, and Dim2 to PC2. The representation of variables differs from the plot of the observations: The observations are represented by their projections, but the variables are represented by their correlations [5].\n\n\nCode\nfviz_pca_biplot(abalone_pca, label = \"var\", alpha.ind = \"contrib\", col.var = \"blue\", repel = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.5.3 Variable Contribution\nTop variable contribution for the first two principal components.\n\n\nCode\n# Contributions of variables to PC1\npc2_contribution &lt;- fviz_contrib(abalone_pca, choice = \"var\", axes = 1, top = 20)\n\n# Modify the theme to rotate X-axis labels to 90 degrees\npc2_contribution +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0)  # horizontal justification\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Contribution of Variables to PC1\",\n       y = \"Percentage Contribution\",\n       x = \"\",\n       caption = \"PC1 explains 83.9% of the variance\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1,\n                                                     accuracy = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Contributions of variables to PC2\npc2_contribution &lt;- fviz_contrib(abalone_pca, choice = \"var\", axes = 2, top = 12)\n\n# Modify the theme to rotate X-axis labels to 90 degrees\npc2_contribution +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0)  # horizontal justification\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(title = \"Contribution of Variables to PC2\",\n       y = \"Percentage Contribution\",\n       x = \"\",\n       caption = \"PC2 explains 8.7% of the variance\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1,\n                                                     accuracy = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Results\nThe first principal component captures 83.9% of the variance in the data. This linear combination has relatively equal loadings for whole weight, diameter, length, shell weight, viscera weight, and shucked weight, with height and rings having lower loadings. The second principal component is mostly influenced by the variable rings which makes up over 80% of the contribution to PC2. The biplot is an effective visualization of how each variable contributes to PC1, or dimension 1 on the graph, and PC2, or dimension 2 on the graph. The length and direction of each vector represent the contribution of each variable to the principal components; whole weight and rings are the longest, representing the largest contributions to PC1 and PC2 respectively.\nPCA is primarily an exploratory tool, which allows us to visualize high-dimensional data in lower dimensions as shown above in the biplot and accompanying scree plot. These PCs can be used to explore data in other ways, such as looking for trends and patterns in the data or identifying clusters and outliers. In the formal analysis in the following chapter, the applications of PCA are further explored through the development of a regression model on the principal components of a dataset.\n\n\n\n\n[1] E.

    "text": "5.6 PCA Implementation\n\n5.6.1 SVD - Singular Value Decomposition\nWe will focus on Singular Value Decomposition which is a classic approach for PCA analysis.\nSingular Value Decomposition is a factorization technique used in linear algebra to decompose a matrix into three matrices.\n\n\\(L\\): A matrix whose columns are the left singular vectors of the original matrix.\n\\(D\\): A diagonal matrix whose entries are the singular values of the original matrix.\n\\(R\\): A matrix whose columns are the right singular vectors of the original matrix.\n\nThe SVD is closely related to the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), which is another factorization technique used in linear algebra. While the EVD can only be applied to square matrices, the SVD can be applied to any matrix, including rectangular matrices. The SVD is also more numerically stable than the EVD, making it a preferred method for many applications.\n\nNote: The Spectral Decomposition approach is used with the princomp() function.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Apply PCA using prcomp()\ndata_pca &lt;- prcomp(train_data_sc, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)\npca_summ &lt;- summary(data_pca)$importance\n\n# Transpose the matrix\ntransposed_pca_summ &lt;- t(pca_summ)\n\n# table format\nkbl(transposed_pca_summ, caption = \"Pricipal Components Analysis\",\n    digits = 4) %&gt;%\n  kable_paper(\"hover\")\n\n\n\nPricipal Components Analysis\n\n\n\nStandard deviation\nProportion of Variance\nCumulative Proportion\n\n\n\n\nPC1\n3.8854\n0.4080\n0.4080\n\n\nPC2\n1.8717\n0.0947\n0.5027\n\n\nPC3\n1.8377\n0.0913\n0.5940\n\n\nPC4\n1.7487\n0.0826\n0.6766\n\n\nPC5\n1.4227\n0.0547\n0.7313\n\n\nPC6\n1.2508\n0.0423\n0.7736\n\n\nPC7\n1.1280\n0.0344\n0.8080\n\n\nPC8\n1.0933\n0.0323\n0.8403\n\n\nPC9\n0.9449\n0.0241\n0.8644\n\n\nPC10\n0.9081\n0.0223\n0.8867\n\n\nPC11\n0.8185\n0.0181\n0.9048\n\n\nPC12\n0.7790\n0.0164\n0.9212\n\n\nPC13\n0.6815\n0.0126\n0.9338\n\n\nPC14\n0.6366\n0.0110\n0.9447\n\n\nPC15\n0.5710\n0.0088\n0.9535\n\n\nPC16\n0.5055\n0.0069\n0.9604\n\n\nPC17\n0.5018\n0.0068\n0.9673\n\n\nPC18\n0.4884\n0.0064\n0.9737\n\n\nPC19\n0.4625\n0.0058\n0.9795\n\n\nPC20\n0.4169\n0.0047\n0.9842\n\n\nPC21\n0.3534\n0.0034\n0.9876\n\n\nPC22\n0.3247\n0.0029\n0.9904\n\n\nPC23\n0.2884\n0.0022\n0.9926\n\n\nPC24\n0.2604\n0.0018\n0.9945\n\n\nPC25\n0.2259\n0.0014\n0.9959\n\n\nPC26\n0.2149\n0.0013\n0.9971\n\n\nPC27\n0.1982\n0.0011\n0.9982\n\n\nPC28\n0.1670\n0.0008\n0.9989\n\n\nPC29\n0.1268\n0.0004\n0.9994\n\n\nPC30\n0.1091\n0.0003\n0.9997\n\n\nPC31\n0.0838\n0.0002\n0.9999\n\n\nPC32\n0.0509\n0.0001\n0.9999\n\n\nPC33\n0.0317\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\nPC34\n0.0287\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\nPC35\n0.0143\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\nPC36\n0.0081\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\nPC37\n0.0049\n0.0000\n1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6.2 PCA - Elements\n\nThe values in `data_pca$x` are the coordinates of each observation in the new principal component space.

The representation of variables differs from the plot of the observations: The observations are represented by their projections, but the variables are represented by their correlations [2].\nPC1 is represented in black which displays the longest distance of its projection.\nPC2 is represented in blue which displays a shorter distance as expected.\n\n\n\nCode\nfviz_pca_biplot(data_pca, \n                geom = c(\"point\", \"arrow\"),\n                geom.var = \"arrow\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7.3 Correlation Circle\nThe plot below is also known as variable correlation plots. It shows the relationships between all variables. It can be interpreted as follow:\n\nPositively correlated variables are grouped together.\nNegatively correlated variables are positioned on opposite sides of the plot origin (opposed quadrants).\nThe distance between variables and the origin measures the quality of the variables on the factor map.

    "text": "The Dialysis dataset consists of 55 observations of 39 variables with 1 discrete variable (States/Territories) and 38 continuous variables. For the principal component analysis, 37 of the 38 continuous variables were used; the variable expected_survival was excluded from PCA in order to use it as a target for model building in the latter part of the analysis.\nPrincipal component analysis was performed using a singular value decomposition approach. Among the resulting principal components, the first PC captures 40.80% of the variance in the data, and the first two principal components capture 50.27% of the variance. The first four PCs capture 67.66% of the variance, or just over two-thirds; after the fourth PC, the variance captured by each successive PC begins to diminish relative to PCs one through four. The first ten PCs capture 88.67% of the variance, and in terms of dimensionality reduction over 90% of the information in the dataset can be explained by only 11 PCs when compared to the original 38 continuous variables.\nThe variables which contribute the most to PC1 are expected_hospital_readmission, expected_transfusion, and expected_hospitalization, although the percent of total contribution to PC1 by any one variable is not outsized relative to the remaining variables. PC2, which is orthogonal to PC1, has relatively large contributions from the five variables measuring levels of phosphorus; patterns or trends in the data such as these can be further explored using other methodologies after being highlighted in PCA [1].\nFrom here, the analysis extends PCA via model building using linear regression with a technique known as principal component regression, with expected_survival used as the response variable. The data is first split into training and testing sets; then the data is centered and scaled, after which PCA is applied to each set. The first model is created for illustrative purposes, using 8 principle components from the training set of 39 observations. The estimates and significance of each PC regressor demonstrates the differences between variance captured from the data and usefulness in a linear model; for example, PC4 is a significant regressor despite capturing less variance than PC3 in the training data.\nThe analysis concludes by building and comparing two linear regression models using the first two prinicipal components. The first model is a straightforward linear model using the lm() function from the stats package in R [2]. The second model uses 10-fold cross-validation for a linear model using the train() and trainControl() functions from the caret package in R [3]. Both models produce an \\(R^2\\) above 96% and a predicted \\(R^2\\) above 95% with a 1% advantage on the cross-validation model. Although the interpretations of the regressors for these PCA models is different than those of a linear regression on the original variables, the lower dimensionality of the data may be desirable as a more simple model which still captures a large portion of the variance in the original data.\n\n\n\n\n[1] R.

    "text": "Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a foundational multivariate analysis technique that has been widely employed to extract essential information from intricate multivariate datasets and effectively reduce dimensionality. Due to its simplicity and versatility, PCA has become one of the widely adopted tools for understanding and exploring data features in a multivariate dataset. This approach leverages singular value decomposition to restructure datasets and facilitates subsequent statistical analysis. By doing so, PCA simplifies complexity, eliminating superfluous details and redundant information arising from the original dataset. The outcome is a set of principal components that capture most of the variance explaining the original variables. To accomplish this, PCA first converts the dataset into a covariance matrix and then employs singular value decomposition to identify eigenvalues and eigenvectors, representing the loadings of the newly generated principal components. These components can typically account for over 70-80% of the original variables’ variances.\nPCA’s importance in data analysis is underscored by its adaptability to various scenarios and data types, including binary, ordinal, compositional, and discrete data. Moreover, the PCA algorithm has proven effective in reducing the dimensions of vast datasets with high accuracy, significantly improving classification tasks. It plays a crucial role in exploratory data analysis and preliminary data processing, acting as a feature extraction and dimensionality reduction tool. One of its main benefits is its ability to mitigate multicollinearity issues, which can otherwise lead to biased results in statistical analyses.\nDespite its numerous advantages, PCA does come with certain limitations. For instance, it is sensitive to the presence of outliers, which can distort the results and compromise its effectiveness. Furthermore, the new features or components generated through PCA are not readily interpretable, making it challenging to explain their meaning in a straightforward manner. Nonetheless, PCA remains a pivotal technique in data analysis, offering a powerful means to navigate complex datasets and uncover their underlying structures."
