    "text": "In recent years, the exponential growth of large datasets with numerous variables have become increasingly prevalent across various fields [1], including but not limited to data analysis, image processing, genetics, finance, and signal processing. [2] Analyzing, processing, and visualizing these multivariate datasets pose significant challenges. Therefore, the significance of unsupervised learning algorithms comes into play, particularly in tasks like dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and visualization of complex data sets. Unsupervised learning is a collection of algorithms to classify raw data. [3] Clustering, and density estimation methods, often serve as a crucial preliminary step in dimensionality reduction where the objective is to find patterns and correlations aiding in organizing the original data. The underlying structures and relationships within the data can inform the selection and application of dimensionality reduction techniques.\nMoreover, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques aim to mitigate the challenge of extracting valuable insights from complex data by reducing the number of dimensions, decreasing computational complexity, eliminating irrelevant and redundant data, improving algorithm accuracy, and facilitating efficient data visualization. [4] Unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction are indispensable tools in data analysis, and machine learning. While unsupervised learning aims to uncover patterns and correlations between raw data, dimensionality reduction simplifies data representation. One widely used DR technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The objectives of the present research project are the comprehensive exploration of PCA, encompassing an introduction to its core concepts, a discussion of its purposes and functions as well as a demonstration of its application through step-by-step examples.\nPrincipal Component Analysis is best described as a dimension reduction technique for statistical data. PCA has its roots in the work of Karl Pearson in his 1901 paper “On Lines and Planes of Closest Fit to Systems of Points in Space” [5] with the later christening and formal development of the technique by Harold Hotelling in 1933. [6] Pearson initially conceptualized PCA as a geometric interpretation within statistics; subsequently, PCA gained recognition as a more suitable method than analysis of variance for modeling response data. [7] The aim of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset without loss of information about the variability of the data. By creating principal components that act as analogues for variables, the statistical information of the dataset can be preserved and compressed into a more easily representable form. A common example of the application of PCA involves reducing an n-dimensional data set into 2 principal components which can be plotted on a graph representing the relationships among the original variables; for this reason, PCA is often described as an exploratory data analysis tool.\n\n1.0.1 Theoretical and mathematical foundations\nThe fundamental concept behind PCA is to explain the variability in a set of correlated variables with a smaller set of uncorrelated variables, thus mitigating issues such as multicollinearity. The geometric properties of PCs facilitate an intuitive interpretation of key features within complex multivariate datasets. [8] The first principal component represents the direction with the greatest variation in the original data, while subsequent components are uncorrelated with the previous ones. Each component can be interpreted as the direction that maximizes the variance of the original data when projecting new observations onto the components. [1] PCA aims to capture a significant proportion of the original variables’ variation in the first few components, offering a practical lower-dimensional summary. While other methods may involve weighted averages across related variables to reduce dimensions, PCA often achieves similar results with minimal loss of variance information. [9] The mathematical foundations of PCA center around data of p variables in n observations, represented by an n x p matrix X with the goal of finding a linear combination of the columns of X which maximize variance. By maximizing the variance in these linear combinations, we can capture the largest amount of statistical information possible among the dimensions of the dataset. As described by Jolliffe and Cadima [2] , this boils down to finding the eigenvectors (a) and the largest eigenvalues () of the covariance matrix S, where Xak are the linear combinations called the principal components. \nWith the development of software packages in computer languages such as R and Python, the computational burden of PCA for large datasets can be easily handled by software; PCA has become easy to use as part of any data processing pipeline. Abdi and Williams describe PCA as “probably the most popular multivariate statistical technique … used by almost all scientific disciplines.” [10] Abdi and Williams also emphasize that the goals of PCA should be extracting only the most important information from a dataset to both compress and simplify the dataset and provide a way to analyze the structure of the observations and variables more easily. Importantly, the authors also offer a geometric description of the principal components as orthogonal factors to the original axis of the dataset; another strength of PCA is the fact that the technique can be explained and expressed through several mathematical avenues. Finally, Abdi and Williams offer methods to evaluate the quality of the “PCA model” in reconstructing the original data matrix using the derived principal components. For example, calculating the residual sum of squares, or RESS, after rebuilding X provides a way to identify model accuracy by seeking a minimal RESS value from X and X. \nLever and Altman offer similar praises of PCA while echoing the cautions of prior authors as a powerful data exploration tool with clear limitations. [11] PCA is best when interesting patterns in data produce statistical variance which can be capture by the principal components, but the technique is far less effective when patterns in data are non-linear or non-orthogonal or when the maximization of variance fails to produce interesting clusters in the principal component space. Scaling is often necessary for PCA to ensure compatibility across variables with different scales and ranges. The original data is typically standardized to have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. [8] PCA can be used improperly to produce results that obfuscate the actual statistical content of the dataset; scaling may influence the analysis with prior knowledge of the data, so the decision to scale the data and the scaling methodology should be considered carefully.\n\n\n1.0.2 Applications and extensions\n\n1.0.2.1 In Archeology, Neuroscience, and the Arts \nPCA has been utilized by many authors across numerous fields as an essential part of a data analysis pipeline. As an example of the application of PCA, Jolliffe and Cadima [2] present a dataset of 88 observations with 9 variables of measurement for fossilized mammal teeth including length in two dimensions, width in two dimensions, and more. With the R statistical language, finding and displaying the principal components of the dataset becomes trivial work where patterns can be identified graphically in a two-dimensional (PC1 x PC2) plot, versus the original scatterplot which would be displayed in nine-dimensional space. The development of statistical software has made it straightforward for practitioners to use PCA for data exploration and dimensionality reduction. Authors such as Maindonald and Braun [12] have produced publications which present techniques and step-by-step methodologies of using R to calculate principal components and graphically display the results. Their presentation includes code snippets which can be run in R software environments along with worked examples and a discussion of results, facilitating the use of the technique for practitioners of all experience levels.\nFelipe Gewers and their research team directly expound on Abdi and Williams’ description of PCA as “the most popular multivariate statistical technique [...]” in an analysis of publications which use PCA: Across twenty-three disciplines ranging from Neuroscience to the Arts, PCA is used to explore a dataset before analysis, used as part of a spectrum of statistical analysis tools prior to modeling and analysis, or used to preprocess and simplify data for direct analysis and modeling. [13] The authors also discuss the broad effectiveness of PCA in representing more than 50% of the variance in most datasets using only the first three principal components. They also highlight how differences in captured variance appear between standardization and non-standardization, and in different fields of study; PCA can be effective in an incredibly diverse array of data when applied appropriately. As an exploratory technique with a long tenure in the field of statistics and data analysis, PCA is tried and true in simplifying datasets and allowing practitioners to identify and explore the largest sources of statistical information present in their data.\nPrincipal Component Analysis is also implemented in Scikit Learn with randomized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction in data analysis, particularly for face recognition and similar high-dimensional data applications. For instance, with an image of 4096 dimensions (64x64 pixel gray scale images) PCA can transform the data into a lower 200 dimension format that still captures the essential information. [14] With randomized SVD it becomes computationally more efficient to approximate the singular vectors, which are then used to perform the transformation. This approach significantly reduces computation time and memory usage. Additionally, PCA decomposes a multivariate dataset into orthogonal components that explain the maximum amount of variance. It can center and optionally scale the input data before applying SVD. Scaling can be useful for downstream models, such as Support Vector Machines with the RBF kernel and K-Means clustering, which assume certain properties of the data distribution.\n\n\n1.0.2.2 Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\nThe Eigenfaces concept has emerged as a groundbreaking approach to facial detection and recognition. The Eigenfaces algorithm employs PCA to extract essential facial features, reducing the dimensionality of face images while retaining crucial information. The Eigenfaces technique represents facial images in high-dimensional space while projecting the images onto a lower-dimensional space. Turk and Pentland demonstrated the effectiveness of Eigenfaces in recognizing faces under various conditions, including variations in lighting, facial expressions, and pose. [15] The potential implications of this research extend beyond face recognition, and have broader implications for image analysis, computer vision, and biometric systems. The paper Eigenfaces by Zhang and Turk provided an insightful exploration of the Eigenfaces method, considered as the first working technique in facial recognition. [16] Eigenfaces leverage the power of PCA to represent facial images compactly and efficiently, making it possible to recognize faces in various contexts.\nThe idea of principal components to represent human faces was developed by Sirovich and Kirby in 1987 and used by Turk and Pentland in 1991 for face detection and recognition. [15] The authors describe the mathematical principles behind PCA, and its adaptation for facial recognition, capturing the most prominent facial features while reducing the dimensionality of the data. Specifically, the eigenfaces are the principal components of a distribution of faces, or the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the set of face images, where an image with N pixels is considered a point (or vector) in N-dimensional space. Emphasis is placed on the versatility of Eigenfaces in handling variations in lighting, pose, and facial expressions, making it a robust tool for real-world applications.\nThis application of PCA represents one of many for a longstanding technique in the rapidly growing field of statistics and data analysis. The unsupervised learning algorithm plays a vital role in dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and visualization of complex data sets. Understanding PCA is crucial for researchers, and students seeking to extract meaningful insights and patterns from high-dimensional data to simplify the decision-making process.\n\n\n\n\n[1] M.

Careful consideration must be given to proper data scaling. PCA finds application in diverse fields such as archaeology, neuroscience, and the arts, enabling practitioners to explore datasets, preprocess data, and streamline analysis. Moreover, it has found utility in computer vision for tasks like facial recognition, showcasing its prowess in reducing dimensionality while preserving crucial information.

    "text": "3.4 Principal Component Analysis\nIn this approach to PCA, SVD is used to extract the most information (variance) from the data matrix while reducing the dimensionality of the data. The first principal component will have the largest possible variance (also called inertia), whose value is defined as a factor score. Factor scores represent a geometric projection of the observations onto the PCs. The second PC, orthogonal to the first, has the second largest variance, and the third PC would continue this pattern. The calculation of PCs via SVD can be understood with the use of matrix operations on a dataset. [4]\n\n3.4.1 Centering and Scaling\nLet our dataset be represented by the \\(N \\times P\\) matrix \\(X\\) comprised of \\(N\\) observations of \\(P\\) variables in the data set, where any element \\(x_{np}\\) represents the \\(n\\)th observation of variable \\(p\\) in the dataset. The matrix \\(X\\) has rank \\(A\\) where \\(A \\leq min\\{N, P\\}\\). The data in \\(X\\) is centered and scaled, such that the mean of each column \\(X_p\\) is 0 and every \\(x_{np}\\) has been standardized with unit variance. We can represent this with the formula:\n\\[\nz_{np} = \\frac{x_{np} - \\bar{x}_{p}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{p}}}\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\n\n\n3.4.2 Eigendecomposition of the Covariance Matrix\nThe aim of PCA is to find some linear combination of the columns of \\(X\\) which maximizes the variance. If we define \\(a\\) as a vector of constants \\(a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_p\\), then \\(Xa\\) represents the linear combination of interest. The variance of \\(Xa\\) is represented by \\(var(Xa) = a^TSa\\), with the covariance matrix \\(S\\), and \\(T\\) representing the transpose operator. Finding the \\(Xa\\) with maximum variance equates to finding the vector \\(a\\) which maximizes the quadratic \\(a^TSa\\), where \\(a^Ta = 1\\). We can write this as \\(a^TSa - \\lambda(a^Ta-1)\\), with the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\). [5] Equating this expression to the null vector \\(0\\) allows us to differentiate with respect to \\(a\\):\n\\[\nSa - \\lambda a = 0 \\Rightarrow Sa = \\lambda a\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nTherefore, \\(a\\) is a unit-norm eigenvector with eigenvalue \\(\\lambda\\) of the covariance matrix \\(S\\). The largest eigenvalue of \\(S\\) is \\(\\lambda_1\\) with the eigenvector \\(a_1\\), which we can define for any eigenvector \\(a\\):\n\\[\nvar(Xa) = a^TSa = \\lambda a^Ta = \\lambda\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nAny \\(p \\times p\\) real symmetric matrix has exactly \\(p\\) real eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_k\\) for \\(k = 1,...,p\\). The corresponding eigenvectors of these eigenvalues can be defined to form an orthonormal set of vectors such that \\(a_k^Ta_{k^T} = 1\\) if \\(k = k^T\\) and zero otherwise. If we consider that \\(S\\) is such a matrix and impose the restriction of orthogonality to the different coefficient vectors of \\(S\\), the full set of eigenvectors of \\(S\\) represent the solutions to finding linear combinations \\(Xa_k\\) which maximize variance while minimizing correlation with prior linear combinations. \\(Xa_k\\) then represent the linear combinations which are the principal components of the dataset with eigenvectors \\(a_k\\) and eigenvalues \\(\\lambda_k\\). The elements of \\(Xa_k\\) are the factor scores of the PCs, while the elements of the eigenvectors \\(a_k\\) represent the loadings of the PCs. [1]\n\n\n3.4.3 Singular Value Decomposition\nNext we define the singular value decomposition of \\(X\\). Let \\(L\\) be the \\(N \\times A\\) matrix of left singular vectors of the matrix; that is, the columns of \\(L\\) are made up of the eigenvectors of \\(XX^T\\). Let \\(R\\) be the \\(P \\times A\\) matrix of right singular vectors; the columns of \\(R\\) are made up of the eigenvectors of \\(X^TX\\). Finally, let \\(D\\) be the diagonal matrix of singular values, meaning the singular values in \\(D\\) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \\(XX^T\\) and \\(X^TX\\), and \\(D^2\\) is defined as the diagonal matrix of the non-zero eigenvalues. We can define the singular value decomposition of matrix \\(X\\) as:\n\\[\nX = LD{R}^T\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nIn this context, the eigenvalues represent the variances of the principal components and summarily contain the important information for the dataset, and we can obtain the PCs of \\(X\\) from the SVD. [6] With the identity matrix \\(I\\), the \\(I \\times R\\) matrix of factor scores can be expressed as:\n\\[\nF = LD\n\\tag{3.6}\\]\nThese factor scores are calculated from the coefficients of the linear combinations in matrix \\(R\\), which can be defined as a projection matrix of the original observations onto the PCs, i.e. the product of \\(X\\) and \\(R\\):\n\\[\nF = LD = LDR^TR = XR\n\\tag{3.7}\\]\nThe matrix \\(R\\) is also referred to as a loading matrix, and \\(X\\) is often described as the product of the factor score matrix and the loading matrix:\n\\[\nX = FR^T\n\\tag{3.8}\\]\nwith the decomposition of \\(F^TF = D^2\\) and \\(R^TR = I\\).\nThe loadings represent the weights of the original variables in the computation of the PCs; in other words, the correlation from -1 to 1 of each variable with the factor score.\nIn a geometric interpretation of PCA, the factor scores measure length on the Cartesian plane. This length represents the projection of the original observations onto the PCs from the origin at \\((0, 0)\\). This is especially useful as a visualization of higher dimension data in two dimensions by utilizing the first two PCs which capture the most variance in the original data. [7]"

Finally, let \\(D\\) be the diagonal matrix of singular values, meaning the singular values in \\(D\\) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \\(XX^T\\) and \\(X^TX\\), and \\(D^2\\) is defined as the diagonal matrix of the non-zero eigenvalues. We can define the singular value decomposition of matrix \\(X\\) as:\n\\[\nX = LD{R}^T\n\\tag{3.2}\\]\nIn this context, the eigenvalues represent the variances of the principal components and summarily contain the important information for the dataset, and we can obtain the principal components of \\(X\\) from the SVD. [4] With the identity matrix \\(I\\), the \\(I \\times R\\) matrix of factor scores can be expressed as:\n\\[\nF = LD\n\\tag{3.3}\\]\nThese factor scores are calculated from the coefficients of the linear combinations in matrix \\(R\\), which can be defined as a projection matrix of the original observations onto the principal components, i.e. the product of \\(X\\) and \\(R\\):\n\\[\nF = LD = LDR^TR = XR\n\\tag{3.4}\\]\nThe matrix \\(R\\) is also referred to as a loading matrix, and \\(X\\) is often described as the product of the factor score matrix and the loading matrix:\n\\[\nX = FR^T\n\\tag{3.5}\\]\nwith the decomposition of \\(F^TF = D^2\\) and \\(R^TR = I\\).\nThe loadings represent the weights of the original variables in the computation of the principal components; in other words, the correlation from -1 to 1 of each variable with the factor score.\nIn a geometric interpretation of PCA, the factor scores measure length on the Cartesian plane. This length represents the projection of the original observations onto the PCs from the origin at \\((0, 0)\\). This is especially useful as a visualization of higher dimension data in two dimensions by utilizing the first two principal components which capture the most variance in the original data. [5]"

    "text": "3.3 Eigenvectors\nPCA uses eigenvectors and their corresponding eigenvalues to calculate the principal components; a brief overview is given here. Eigen is a German word meaning inherent or characteristic, and an eigenvector can be described geometrically as a nonzero vector \\(a\\) of a linear transformation matrix \\(M\\) which does not change direction when the transformation is applied; the only change that occurs is a scaling by factor \\(\\lambda\\), the eigenvalue of the eigenvector \\(a\\). Such a characteristic vector is useful in PCA, where the goal is to maximize variance while reducing dimensionality, and in this context the eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be thought of as the inherent components of the dataset which contain the most important information. Eigenvalues can be calculated from the characteristic polynomial of the matrix, by taking the determinant of \\(M - \\lambda I\\), where \\(I\\) is the identity matrix. Setting this expression equal to zero allows the calculation of the eigenvalues as the roots of the characteristic polynomial; the resulting equation is called the characteristic equation:\n\\[\ndet(M - \\lambda I) = 0\n\\tag{3.1}\\]\nAn eigenvalue \\(\\lambda_k\\) can be used to solve for some eigenvector \\(a_k\\) with the equation \\((M - \\lambda I)a = 0\\). With PCA, we can use the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix to compute the PCs. [3]"
